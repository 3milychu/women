	<h1>About the Data</h1>

	<h2 style="padding-left:20%;">Indicators &amp; Sources</h2>

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Women in Managerial Positions</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Data on women in managerial positions was sourced from a training hosted by the United Nations OICT - Analytics, Business Intelligence and Reporting Section on Gender Data Analytics. See column "w_mgr" in the raw dataset used <a href="https://3milychu.github.io/women/assets/gender_stats.csv" target="_blank">here</a>.

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Post-secondary education attainment by gender</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Data on education attainment by gender was sourced from a training hosted by the United Nations OICT - Analytics, Business Intelligence and Reporting Section on Gender Data Analytics. See columns "female_ed", "male_ed" and "diff" in the raw dataset used <a href="https://3milychu.github.io/women/assets/gender_stats.csv" target="_blank">here</a>. Column "diff" was calculated by subtracting male_ed from female_ed.

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Labor Population</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Data on total labor population was sourced from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/gender-statistics" target="_blank">World Bank's Gender Statistics Data Bank</a>. See column "Labor" in the raw dataset used <a href="https://3milychu.github.io/women/assets/gender_stats.csv" target="_blank">here</a>.

	<h2 style="padding-left:20%;">Core Learnings</h2>

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">The Impact of Education on the Female Managerial Landscape</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Surprisingly, the correlation between female managers (%) and female education (%) is not statistically significant in and of itself. It is the difference between female education (%) and male education (%) that correlates with female managers (%) at a statistically significant level even when controlling for all other variables in the dataset.
