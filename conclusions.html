	<h1>Conclusions</h1>

	<h2 style="padding-left:20%;">Findings</h2>

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">1. Female managers is only explained by difference in education out of all variables</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	After running a multiple regression analysis, no other variable in the dataset (labor population, women representation in different economic sectors, female and male attainment of post-secondary education in and of itself) correlated with female managers except difference in education at a statistically significant level (p-value < 0.001). This is true even after controlling for after all variables in the dataset. This does not mean that no other variable is important, but that the correlation does not pass the test of statistic significance.

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">2. Post-secondary attainment explains half a percentage point increase in female managers</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	For each +1% increase in proportion of female post-secondary education, proportion of female managers increases .57 percentage points.

	<h2 style="padding-left:20%;">Limitations</h2>

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Developing regions underrepresented</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Asian, Africam and Latin American &amp; the Caribbean regions were underrepresented in the dataset. There was a shortage of available data matching female manager data with female post-secondary education attainment.

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Other significant variables not included in regression</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Running a multiple regression analysis including other significant variables would be more rigorous. While no other variables in the dataset correlated significantly and were thus unusable, efforts could be made to reconcile this dataset with other country economic and demographic data.

	<h2 style="padding-left:20%;">Final Thoughts</h2>

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Education is not enough</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Education is currently not enough to increase female representation at the managerial level. While it is important, the current analysis suggests that female manager representation must be more dependent on other factor(s). For future, it would be interesting to examine the effect of media waves (i.e. Uber, womens rights events (i.e. the Womens March) on female manager representation. A multiple regression analysis should be conducted for data points such as years of experience, size of professional network and age at marriage. Data collection that matches the collection methods used in the current dataset would be ideal.

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Developed regions: Don't hire her because she's a woman</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	What explains the jaggedness in the female manager landscape for developed regions? Female managerial representation remains consistently low when females have less education than males, but spikes unpredictably when more females have post-secondary education than males before it reaches a smooth ascent and descent at 10% more females in a population with post-secondary education. Compare this with the male landscape for developed regions, where they hold the 70% threshold consistently when more males than females have post-secondary education. Things don't get unpredictable for males until 1.1% more males have post-secondary education than females.
	<br>
	My hypothesis (untested) is that it may have something to do with developed nations' application of women's equality. Because womens rights is also trending, there may be more of a tendency to "hire a woman" as a checkbox. This behavior may lead to inconsistent and mixed signals to women seeking decision-maker roles. Why did Mary get the responsibility, but Sandy didn't? There may be very few consistencies if the logic is to hire someone meets your woman criteria. If we wanted to see equality in the data, we might be better off hoping for a predictable landscape similiar to males, where women have a seat of the table as long as they get educated, and the terrain is expectedly rocky if they're not. 
	<br><br>
	Then again, female and males are still different in ways you cannot overlook. In this line of thought: Imagine the most sensible female manager landscape. What would that look like instead?
	<br><br>
	Overall, if the data disturbs you, what action should you take? I think the most simple is: Don't promote her because she's a woman - and she can do the job well. Promote her because she's the perfect one for the job - and if she's a woman, that's a bonus ;)
