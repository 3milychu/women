	<h1>Conclusions</h1>

	<h2 style="padding-left:20%;">Findings</h2>

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">1. Female managers is only explained by difference in education out of all variables tested</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	After running a multiple regression analysis, no other variable in the dataset (labor population, women representation in different economic sectors, female and male attainment of post-secondary education in and of itself) correlated with female managers except difference in education at a statistically significant level (p-value < 0.001). This is true even after controlling for after all variables in the dataset. This does not mean that no other variable is important, but that the correlation does not pass the test of statistic significance.

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">2. Post-secondary attainment explains half a percentage point increase in female managers</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	For each +1% increase in proportion of female post-secondary education, proportion of female managers increases .57 percentage points.

	<h2 style="padding-left:20%;">Limitations</h2>

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Developing regions underrepresented</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Asian, African and Latin American &amp; the Caribbean regions were underrepresented in the dataset. There was a shortage of available data matching female manager data with female post-secondary education attainment.

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Other significant variables not included in regression</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Running a multiple regression analysis including other significant variables would be more rigorous. While no other variables in the dataset correlated significantly and were thus unusable, efforts could be made to reconcile this dataset with other country economic and demographic data.

	<h2 style="padding-left:20%;">Questions Left Unaswered</h2>

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Education is not enough</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Education does not satisficatorily explain female representation at the managerial level. While it is important, the current analysis suggests that female manager representation must be more dependent on other factor(s). A multiple regression analysis should be conducted with independent variables including years of experience, size of professional network, number of children and age at marriage. Data collection that matches the collection methods used in the current dataset would be ideal.

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">When the job gets tougher, who do you turn to?</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	Isn't it interesting that currently, if you pass more than 10% skilled females than males in a population, female managerial representation goes down by about 10%? Why is this? Besides the "she had a baby argument", is it possible that when hiring for highly specialized or tougher positions, we fall back on our stereotypes? Who would you entrust this job that you don't even understand to - a male or a female?
	</p>

	<h4 style="padding-left:20%;">Developed regions: Playing a game of hot and cold?</h4>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	What explains the jaggedness in the female manager landscape for developed regions? Female managerial representation remains consistently low when females have less education than males, but spikes and dips unpredictably when more females have post-secondary education than males before it reaches a smooth ascent and descent at 10% more females in a population with post-secondary education. Overall female representation rises with education difference, but why the volatility?
	<br><br>
	Compare this with the male landscape for developed regions, where they hold the 70% threshold consistently when more males than females have post-secondary education. Things don't get unpredictable for males until 1.1% more males have post-secondary education than females.
	<br><br>
	Let's take a step back and ask ourselves, "What message do we want to be sending to young women attempting to educate themselves and take on decision-making roles?" How would we intentionally reshape the landscape?
